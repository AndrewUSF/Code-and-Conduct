          <p>
            A local court in Munich dismissed a copyright claim earlier this February that sought copyright protection over logos generated by generative AI.
            The court held that the logos were not eligible for copyright protection, even where a human allegedly invested many hours refining prompts.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to the ruling, copyright protection could theoretically apply where—despite the use of AI—the design is the result of a “human creative influence,” and the AI is used as a tool rather than an “independent creative instrument.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The court emphasized that to be eligible for copyright protection, the output must be an “original creation.” In the context of GenAI output, that could be the case when prompts contain creative elements that are so dominant that the output as a whole can be considered the human creator’s own creation.
            In this case, one logo resulted from a single short prompt; another used a very long prompt, but it was open-ended such that key creative decisions were still left to the AI.
          </p>

          <p>
            The fact that a human performed multiple revisions and adjustments to the AI-generated logo did not render it copyrightable because the revisions were technical rather than creative.
            The analysis suggests the outcome might differ where AI output is used only as a draft and later changes are significant and creative.
