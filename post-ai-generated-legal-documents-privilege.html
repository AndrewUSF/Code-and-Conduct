            Attorney-client privilege protects the confidentiality of communications between clients and their attorneys.
            Earlier in February, a federal judge in the Southern District of New York asserted during a hearing that documents generated by a defendant using AI—and then sent to his lawyers—were not protected by attorney-client privilege.
          </p>

          <p>
            In its motion seeking a ruling that “documents… generated through an AI Tool are not privileged,” the government argued that the AI tool generating the documents was not an attorney and therefore no privilege should apply.
            The motion also pointed to the AI platform’s terms of use stating that the tool does not provide legal advice and is not subject to attorney-client privilege.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, the government argued that by sharing information with the AI platform, the defendant rendered the information non-confidential—especially where the platform’s privacy policy permitted disclosure of information to authorities.
