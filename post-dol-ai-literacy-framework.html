          <p>
            The Department of Labor has recently released its Artificial Intelligence Literacy Framework, encouraging education and workplace systems to integrate AI literacy in an impactful manner.
            This voluntary framework contains recommendations on both the content of AI literacy programs and their method of delivery, emphasizing principles such as experimental learning, agility and complementary human skills.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Department of Labor’s framework includes two main parts. The first, titled “Foundational Content Areas of AI Literacy,” focuses on five AI-related skills recommended for students, workers, employers and state and local agencies.
            These skills include “Understanding AI Principles”; “Explore AI uses”; “Direct AI effectively”; “Evaluate AI outputs”; and “Use AI responsibly,” and the framework provides concrete examples for each.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second part, titled “Effective Delivery Principles of AI Literacy,” covers strategies (with examples) for teaching and learning the skills described above.
            These strategies include, among others, experimental learning, learning in context, design for agility, and approaches that help learners understand how AI complements human skills.
